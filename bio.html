                    <p>I was born in 1964 in the USSR. Studied at the school, worked at a factory, served in the army, studied at the institute. And then this country came to an end. It happened. From 1991 to May 2021, I lived in Russia. In May 2021, I left the country for good. That's what I thought when I left. So I think now. Living in the country has become completely impossible. On February 24, 2022, Putin approved my decision to emigrate.</p>
                    <p class="mark">You have already read this once on qrz. I'll add details.</p>
                    <p>Childhood was happy and carefree. Father was a submarine officer. As they said then - the nuclear shield of the country. I grew up in Kamchatka (RAØZ land). There he took up the soldering iron for the first time. Assembled a simple detector receiver.</p>
                    <p>In 1978, my father retired. For the last three years of school, I studied in the North Caucasus. First sex, first love, first (and last) drug... Everything was there. Then I worked in a factory and studied at radio school before the army. To become a radio operator. That's where I got into amateur radio.</p>
                    <p>Before receiving the first call sign, younsgters gained experience at the collective (club) station of the radio school in the city of Nalchik UK6XAA. Where I was an errand boy - to hold the antenna being fixed so it doesn’t fall and run for vodka for the "right kind" of hams.</p>
                    <p>From 1982 to 1984 I served in the army for two years. I promised not to tell anyone about this. I even signed a paper. 40 years have passed and the country I promised to keep my mouth shut is not there no more. But once you give your word, you have to keep it.</p>
                    <p>Then the coup in August 1991. The death of the country in which I grew up. New Russia. A year of turmoil in the White House with radio station R3A.</p> 
                    <div class="box_cont_text">
                        <p> Then I was kicked out and from the autumn of 1992 I just lived a normal life.</p>
                        <p>Was married for 10 years. I was happy. I went along with the country through all its stages of its transformation, as it grew into today's monster.</p>
                        <p>And two years ago, my patience have ran out. Things have gotten worse. I could not stand the transformation of the country into Gulag and decided to leave.</p>
                        <p>If not wasn't for the stroke I had in 2016 maybe I would have stayed. To fight for a different tomorrow. But with poor health, what kind of a fighter am I? (A little pathos).</p>
                        <p>This is how I left Russia in May 2021.</p>
                        <p>However, Putin continues to affect my mindset. I wish to see him gone from the face of the Earth.</p>
                        <p class="mark">Dot.</p>
                        <p>Well, what else about me... I remember my ICQ number, I don't like beans, I always choose a dark theme in the browser.</p>
                        <p>I use the name "Gran" for all QSOs.</p>
