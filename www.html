                    <p>I need the money.</p>
                    <p>I'm not one Robinson Crusoe and I don't live on an island. I don't even have a Friday. Money needed daily.</p>
                    <p>I made my first website in 1994. For my workplace. It was unique in its own right as there were only few hundred sites in Russia at that time. So mine was one of the first.</p>
                    <p>Then I was an expert. But over the years, I fell behind. Today I understand everything about the art of design, but I don’t know much about the latest technologies. But we have a team of specialists. They know how to put everything together and know how to do it today. Here is my site produced by the team.</p>
                    <p>If you need a website for yourself, we are ready to do anything one can come up with. It will be done quickly, exactly as you want and it will be beautiful. The qrz is full of crooked pages showing photos with thousands of dollars worth of equipment on one's desk. And almost no one has a website. Just pathetic qrz pages. How come?</p>
                    <p>Need it for business? Consider doing it.</p>
                    <p>For a friend? For the family? A Shop? For any purpose whatsoever? Just do it.</p>
                    <p>We will select and set up hosting and monitor it for you.</p>
                    <p>We bow call ourselves the "<a href="team.xv9g.cov" class="team_site">XV9G team</a>"</p>

                        <h2>A warning for the not so faint-hearted.</h2>
                        <p>Everything posted on this site is written by me, with my own hands, with my thoughts and about me. Thus, I do not object to the theft (borrowing) of the text, pulling it apart into quotes, re-telling my jokes to your friends, misrepresenting what you have read and interpreting it in other words. In case you need it.
                        </p>
                        <p>All photos are either taken by me personally or of me on my request, if I am in the photo. I absolutely do not mind if you purloin the photos from the site. Well, do you have to? In general, I impose no sanctions for content theft/borrowing. What else can I say? ... Oh, yes - send money. Please do! God bless the “Google Translate”.
